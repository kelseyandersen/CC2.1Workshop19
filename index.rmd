### Pre-Workshop Set Up

Make sure you have the most recent versions of R and R Studio Installed on your computer.  

* R can be downloaded at [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* R Studio can be downloaded for free at [www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Also, it would be useful (but not necessary) to download the following R packages prior to the workshop:  

* tidyverse   
* igraph  
* hmisc   
* Matrix   

For new R useRs: open R studio and type the following code into the console, OR you can go over the "Packages" tab in the bottom right hand corner of R studio, click "install", and type in the names of the packages that you would like to install. Once you have installed a package on your computer, there is no need to install again. Instead, each time you need to use the package you use the *library()* code (as shown below). 
```
install.packages("igraph")

library(igraph) 

install.packages("Hmisc")

library(Hmisc) 

install.packages("Matrix")

library(Matrix)  
```
